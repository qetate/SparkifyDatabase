## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for the Sparkify database, a data warehouse designed to store and analyze song and log data from a music streaming application. The project includes scripts for creating tables, processing song and log data, and inserting records into the database.

## Technologies Used
- **Python#**: Programming language for data manipulation and database interaction
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system.
- **Pandas**: Library for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment used for executing code and documenting the analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **ETL Process Design**: Extracting data from JSON files, transforming it, and loading it into a PostgreSQL database.
- **Database Operations**: Creating and managing database tables, inserting records, and handling conflicts.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating bar charts and pie charts to illustrate findings.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Converting timestamps, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
